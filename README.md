# spotify_analysis
Data analysis of personal Spotify data and publicly available Spotify data. 

For this project, I used 8 Machine Learning supervised classification algorithms to create new running playlists. I used my own personal listening history, Spotify's API, and several other publicly available datasets to gather, clean, and feature engineer the data. 

## Results 
The KKN, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes algorithms created the best playlists according to F1 score metrics. On May 24, I'll listen to each playlist while running to see how well the algorithms created playlists that match my tastes.
